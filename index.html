            <h2>History of Christmas</h2>
            <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, 
                observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration 
                among billions of people around the world. The holiday has its origins in 
                Christian traditions, with historical links to winter solstice festivals in 
                Europe. Over time, it has evolved to incorporate various cultural customs, 
                including gift-giving, decorating Christmas trees, and sharing meals with 
                family and friends.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Christmas in Thailand</h2>
            <p>Christmas in Thailand is celebrated mostly as a secular holiday, 
                as the majority of Thais practice Buddhism. However, due to globalization 
                and cultural exchanges, Christmas has gained popularity in urban areas and 
                among the younger population. The holiday became more prominent in Thailand 
                during the late 20th century, with shopping malls and businesses adopting 
                festive decorations, hosting events, and promoting sales during the season.</p>
